# GreanTeam

During the Platinion Hackathon 2023 in DÃ¼sseldorf, we built a gamification to motivate people to use more sustainable means of transport. For that we use the Google Location History to identify regular trips (e.g. home to school) and to give points points for using green ways of transport. These points could be used for disounts, tickets for events and more awards, sponsered by companies and people who want to contribute to reducing CO2 of employess/whole cities.
